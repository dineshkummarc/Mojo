# Mojolite javascript framework


## Why create another Framework?

Early 2007, Blast Mojo was born in order to:

* Provide a standard, consistent architecture for developing with JavaScript
* Work with different libraries without conflict
* Structure and organize JavaScript
* Enforce separation of concerns
* Ensure code can be shared and re-used


## Why use Mojolite?

* Blast Mojo offers a foundation that other libraries and developers can take advantage of. It was built to provide a consistent architectural structure for development of small to massive projects allowing for code reuse and flexibility

* Enforces organization and clean separation of code to ease readability and maintainability

* Includes Mojo StdLib library which consists of well-tested and reusable behaviors and components for rapid prototyping and development
 
* Increases productivity of large teams working in parallel, particularly on Agile projects, by dividing work into implementation silos and allowing incremental development

* Reduces developer ramp-up time starting on new projects because they are already accustomed to the coding structures, patterns and practices

* Development speeds up as times goes on compared to the opposite that happens when code becomes too tightly bound

## Contributing

Post patches to the “Blast Mojo Mailing List” : http://groups.google.com/group/blast-mojo

* Discuss large changes on mailing list before coding
* Javascript code style
  * has two space indention
  * maximum 80 column width
  * keywords followed by open-paren must be separated by a space. eg. if (condition) not if(condition)
  * no space between function name and open paren e.g. functionName(parameters) not functionName (parameters)
  * multi-line if statements must have braces.
* patches should all pass JSLint http://jslint.com
