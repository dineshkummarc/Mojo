I'm Mojo!\r\nI'm a JavaScript Microframework that lets your teams write code in implementation silos and use best practices, such as, publish/subscribe, aspect-oriented programming, dependency injection, and integration via Service Locator pattern.\r\n\r\nI'm easy to get along with, check this out!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:jbueza/Mojo.git\r\n$ cd Mojo\r\n$ ant\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why use me?\r\n\r\nMojo offers a foundation that other libraries and developers can take advantage of. It was built to provide a consistent architectural structure for development of small to massive projects allowing for code reuse and flexibility\r\n\r\n* Enforces organization and clean separation of code to ease readability and maintainability\r\n* Capability to pull any jQuery plugin for rapid prototyping and development\r\n* Increases productivity of large teams working in parallel, particularly on Agile projects, by dividing work into implementation silos and allowing incremental development\r\n* Reduces developer ramp-up time starting on new projects because they are already accustomed to the coding structures, patterns and practices\r\n* Development speeds up as times goes on compared to the opposite that happens when code becomes too tightly bound\r\n\r\n### Who's using me?\r\n\r\n* Microsoft - https://kinectshare.com\r\n* Lululemon - http://salutationnation.com\r\n* Bacardi - http://www.trueoriginals.com\r\n* RESAAS - http://www.resaas.com\r\n* Agile Business Cloud Solutions Ltd - http://www.agilebusinesscloud.com\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me at @jbueza on Twitter or jbueza on Github.
